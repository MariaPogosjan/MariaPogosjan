### Hi, I'am Maria but everybody calls me Poggi 👋 

Born in Armenia, raised in Sweden/Stockholm. I love to come up with crazy ambitious ideas and make them come to life. I wanted to work with development and went from thinking about it to actually do something about it. Six months later I learned to code professionally 👩🏻‍💻 And today it is my biggest passion in life. 

Other crazy things I accomplished with is:

- 📚 I’ve graduated from the Front-end Development Program Technigo in June 2021.
- 👯 I love meeting new people 
- :tada: I get high on life when I solve a code problem 
- ⚡ I came up with the idea to deliver healthy “fika” boxes to companies and it ended with me rolling more than 10.000 raw balls.
