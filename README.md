### Hi, I'am Maria but everyone calls me Poggi 👋 

Born in Armenia, raised in Sweden/Stockholm. I love to come up with crazy ambitious ideas and make them come to life. I wanted to work with development and went from thinking about it to actually do something about it. Six months later I learned to code professionally 👩🏻‍💻 And today it is my biggest passion in life. 

### Other crazy things I about me:

- 📚 I’ve graduated from the Web Development Program with Technigo in June 2021.
- :tada: I get high on life when I solve a code problem. 
- ⚡ I came up with the idea to deliver healthy “fika” boxes to companies and it ended with me rolling more than 10.000 raw balls.
